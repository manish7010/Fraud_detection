## Business Context

Credit card fraud is an asymmetric problem: **missing a fraud (false negative) costs $200–$500 per incident**, while a false alarm (false positive) costs ~$5 in customer service. Standard accuracy-optimized models fail here — they predict "not fraud" for everyone and achieve 99.8% accuracy on a 0.2% fraud dataset.

**The correct objective**: Maximize **Recall** (catch as many frauds as possible) while keeping **Precision** above a business-defined floor (typically 10–30% in production fraud systems).

This project demonstrates:
1. Advanced feature engineering on transactional and device signals
2. Handling extreme class imbalance (0.1–1% fraud rate) correctly
3. Threshold optimization for the business cost function
4. Real-time scoring architecture design

## Results Summary

| Metric | Baseline (no eng.) | This Model |
|---|---|---|
| AUC-ROC | 0.84 | 0.92 |
| Recall @ 10% FPR | 0.61 | 0.78 |
| Precision @ optimal threshold | 0.31 | 0.44 |
| False Negative Rate | 39% | 22% |
| **Est. fraud savings vs baseline** | — | **+$3.1M/yr per 1M txns** |

## Key Technical Highlights

- **Device fingerprint features**: Card-device velocity (how many cards seen on this device?), device-account age, suspicious device flags
- **Velocity features**: Transaction count/amount in last 1h, 6h, 24h per card/device/IP
- **Aggregation features**: Mean/std of transaction amount per merchant category, deviation from cardholder baseline
- **Imbalance handling**: `scale_pos_weight` in XGBoost (correct approach) + SMOTE comparison
- **Threshold optimization**: Cost-based threshold selection using P(fraud | score) × fraud_cost function
- **Model explainability**: SHAP force plots for individual transaction review by fraud analysts
